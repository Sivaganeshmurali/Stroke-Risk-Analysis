# 🧠 Stroke Risk Analysis using Google Colab

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a healthcare dataset to identify significant factors contributing to stroke risk. Using Python in Google Colab, we performed data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis, and visualized trends across age, BMI, gender, and smoking status.

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `stroke_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and visualizations
- `Dataset/stroke_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset used in the analysis
- `Visualizations/`: Exported charts from the notebook
- `README.md`: Project summary and insights

---

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- (Optional) Scikit-learn for modeling

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Age** is the most significant risk factor for stroke; most stroke cases occur above age 60.
- Majority of patients **never smoked**, yet strokes occurred across all smoking statuses.
- **Females slightly outnumber males** in stroke occurrence.
- **BMI** distribution is right-skewed; most values are in the 25–35 (overweight) range.
- The dataset is **imbalanced**, with stroke cases being a minority.

## 📸 Sample Visualizations
- Age distribution & stroke risk
- Gender vs Stroke outcome
- Correlation heatmap
- Smoking status impact

> Visuals are available in the `/Visualizations/` folder and inline in the notebook.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Upload to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or run locally with Jupyter Notebook.
3. Install required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) if not already available.
4. Run the cells step-by-step to explore the analysis.
